# PyFisher
*Script for automated Minecraft fishing, based on visual bobber state detection.*

Ever since the [1.16](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Java_Edition_1.16) update, autofishing in Minecraft has gotten more difficult. 
This Python script eases the pain by automating fishing by detecting the current state of the catch and reeling in when required.

Features:
- Automatic detection of the active fishing bobber  
- Customizable parameters
- Dashboard display for current tick state and the amount of catches
